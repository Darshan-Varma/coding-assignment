# Marketing Coding Assignment #

A short coding assignment for prospective new hires. 

## The Challenge: Build a Web-based Search App ##

Using [Lucene.NET](https://lucenenet.apache.org/) and .NET Core, build an easy-to-use and visually pleasing web-based search application.

## Basic Features: :seedling: ##
- For test data, use the included movies.csv file.
- The website should load and index the test data.
- The app should allow the user to enter keywords and find your indexed content.
- Your app should also feature a responsive design to ensure it renders well for a variety of screen sizes and resolutions.

## Advanced Features: :mortar_board: ##
- Faceting - Provide faceting options for the user to filter by (for example, the ability to search by the date when the film was released).
- Stemming - when searching for “engineer”, the search should also return results for “engineering”, “engineers”, and “engineered”.
- Spell checking - present corrected search terms for user misspellings.
- Related search terms - after a user searches, suggesting alternate keywords related to what they’ve already searched for.
- Auto-complete - suggest search terms as the user types in the search box.

You don’t have to code all of the advanced features! Choose the features you want to implement – the scope can be as simple or complex as you want, but we want to see polish. We leave it a little ambiguous on purpose, please feel free to be creative and show us how you like to design and write code.

## We’re looking for the following: :eyeglasses: ##

- Can you research and learn something new that you might not be entirely familiar with?
- Can you ask the right questions to get what you need?
- Can you manage your time effectively to deliver something of value?
- Can you design something that is easy-to-use and visually pleasing?

*If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to ask. Asking for clarification is encouraged.

## Updates: ##
- 2023-06-08 Added some sample code to serve as a starting point (delete indexed data, index new data, perform simple search on indexed data).
