# Marketing Coding Assignment #

A short coding assignment for prospective new hires. 

## The Challenge: Build a Web-based Search App ##

Using [Lucene.NET](https://lucenenet.apache.org/) and .NET Core, build an easy-to-use and visually pleasing web-based search application.

## Basic Features: :seedling: ##
- For test data, use the included movies.csv file.
- The website should load and index the test data.
- The app should allow the user to enter keywords and find your indexed content.
- Your app should also feature a responsive design to ensure it renders well for a variety of screen sizes and resolutions.

## Advanced Features (Optional): :mortar_board: ##
- Faceting - Provide faceting options for the user to filter by (for example, the ability to search by the date when the film was released).
- Stemming - when searching for “engineer”, the search should also return results for “engineering”, “engineers”, and “engineered”.
- Spell checking - present corrected search terms for user misspellings.
- Related search terms - after a user searches, suggesting alternate keywords related to what they’ve already searched for.
- Auto-complete - suggest search terms as the user types in the search box.

You don’t have to code all (or any) of the advanced features! Please don't start on these unless the basic features are working. If you have extra time, choose the advanced features you want to implement – the scope can be as simple or complex as you want, but we want to see polish. We leave it a little ambiguous on purpose; feel free to be creative and show us how you like to design and write code.

## We’re looking for the following: :eyeglasses: ##

- Can you research and learn something new that you might not be entirely familiar with?
- Can you ask the right questions to get what you need?
- Can you manage your time effectively to deliver something of value? 
- Can you design something that is easy-to-use and visually pleasing?
- Can you use version control correctly?
- Can you follow instructions and meet scope requirements?

*If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to ask. Asking for clarification is encouraged.

:warning: When you are finished, please update your readme with a description of which features you implemented and your process for solving the problem.

## Updates: ##
- 2023-06-08 Added some sample code to serve as a starting point (delete indexed data, index new data, perform simple search on indexed data).
- 2023-06-19 Added a note to update the readme with their own notes and experience.
- 2023-09-08 Added notes that advanced features are optional due to reduced time expectations. Added notes about what we're looking for.
